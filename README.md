# Motion-distance-detection-control
Motion &amp; Distance Detection Control – A web-based IoT dashboard for monitoring motion detection, measuring distance using sensors, and controlling an LED with manual and automatic modes.
Motion & Distance Detection Control

This project is an IoT-based motion and distance detection system with a simple web interface.
It allows users to:

✅ Monitor motion status in real-time

📏 Display the measured distance (in cm) from an ultrasonic or proximity sensor

🚨 Show warnings when objects are too close

💡 Control an LED with three modes:

Turn ON

Turn OFF

Auto Mode (based on sensor input)

🌐 Features

Real-time updates of motion status and distance.

Interactive LED control via buttons (ON / OFF / Auto).

Distance warnings displayed in red when a threshold is reached.

Supports integration with microcontrollers like ESP32 / ESP8266 / Arduino.
